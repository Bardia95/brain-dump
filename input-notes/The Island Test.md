The Island Test

- Handy test for figuring out what you’re addicted to
	- Imagine you were going to spend the weekend at a friend’s house on a little island off the coast of Maine
	- There are no shops on the island and you won’t be able to leave while you’re there
	- Also, you’ve never been to this house before so you can’t assume it will have more than any house might
	- What besides clothes and toiletries do you make a point of packing? That’s what your addicted to
- There’s a kind of thinking, when you’re starting something new that requires complete quiet
	- Can strike at any time
