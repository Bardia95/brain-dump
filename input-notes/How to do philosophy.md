How to do philosophy

- It does seem to be very important to be able to flip ideas around one’s head: to see when two ideas don’t fully cover the space of possibilities or when one idea is the same as another but with a couple things changed
- There’s no central indivisible thing that your identity goes with
- The real lesson here is that concepts we use in everyday life are fuzzy and break down if pushed too hard
- Outside of math, there’s a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings
- Everyday words are inherently imprecise
	- They work well enough in everyday life that you don’t notice
	- Words seem to work, just as Newtonian physics seems to
		- But you can always make them break if you push far enough
	- This has been, unfortunately for philosophy, the central fact of their study
		- Most philosophical debates are not merely afflicted by but driven by confusion over words
- Most philosophical controversies are due to confusions over language
- It’s suspiciously hard to find a field of math that truly has no practical use
- While ideas don’t have to have immediate practical applications to be interesting, the kinds of things we find interesting will surprisingly often turn out to have practical applications
- If you write in an unclear way about big ideas, you produce something that seems tantalizingly attractive to inexperienced by intellectually ambitious students
	- Till one knows better, its hard to distinguish something that’s hard to understand because the writer was unclear in his own mind from something like a mathematical proof that’s hard to understand because the ideas it represents are hard to understand
		- To someone who hasn’t learned the difference, traditional philosophy seems extremely attractive: as hard as math, yet broader in scope
- There’s a market for writing that sounds impressive and can’t be disproven
	- There will always be both supply and demand
	- So if one group abandons this territory, there will always be others ready to occupy it
- **A Proposal**
	- Instead of: What are the most general truths?
	- Ask: Of all the useful things we can say, which are the most general?
	- An example of a useful general idea, consider that of the controlled experiment, the idea of evolution is another
	- Philosophy should look like quite general observations that would cause someone who understood them to do something differently
		- Such observations will necessarily be about things that are imprecisely defined
		- Once you start using words with precise meanings, you’re doing math
			- So starting from utility won’t entirely solve that problem
	- The usefulness test will tend to produce results that annoy people: there’s no use in telling people things they already believe, and people are often upset to be told things they don’t
	- You can start by writing things that are useful but very specific, and then gradually make them more general
		- Joe’s has good burritos, but what makes a good burrito, what makes good food, what makes anything good?
			- You can take as long as you want
			- You don’t have to get all the way to the top of the mountain
	- Philosophy is as young now as math was in 1500
		- There is a lot more to discoveris not much use, because despite some progress in the last 150 years we’re still only able to formalize a small percentage of statements
