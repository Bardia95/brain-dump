**Are software patents evil?**
**
**
- To be patentable, an invention has to be more than new it also has to be non-obvious
- Startups rarely get sued for patent infringement
	- Only two reasons someone might sue you:
		- For money 
		- To prevent you from competing with them
- When you see a big company threatening patent suits, sell
- If your startup grows big enough you’ll start to get sued no matter what you do
	- No one will sue you for patent infringement till you have money and once you have money people will sue you whether they have grounds or not
- If a startup wants to grow into a big company, they should apply for parents to build up the patent portfolio they’ll need to maintain an armed truce with other big companies
	- If they want to get bought, they should apply for patents because patents are part of the mating dance with acquirers
- Startup acquisitions are usually a build-vs-buy decision for the acquirer
	- Two things especially make them decide not to build their own:
		- If you already have a large and rapidly growing user base
		- If you have a fairly solid patent application on critical parts of your software
- In other fields, companies regularly sue competitors for patent infringement
- Things always seem intangible when you don’t understand them
- Good hackers care a lot about matters of principle and they are highly mobile
	- If a company starts misbehaving, smart people won’t work there
		- For some reason this seems to be more true in software than in other businesses
