**The age of the essay**
**
**
- High schools imitate universities
	- Students imitate their English teachers
	- Who are imitating classical scholars
		- Who are merely the inheritors of a tradition out of what was 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed work
- A real essay doesn’t take a position and defend it
- Defending a position may be a necessary evil in a legal dispute but it’s not the best way to get at the truth
	- You miss subtleties this way
	- The real problem is that you can’t change the question
- This principle is built into the very structure of the things they teach you to write in high school
- The topic sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the supporting paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict and the conclusion… what is the conclusion?
	- It seemed that we were just supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph but in different enough words that no one could tell
	- Why bother?
		- When you understand the origins of this sort of essay you can see where the conclusion comes from
			- It’s the concluding remarks to the jury
- Good writing should certainly be convincing but it should be convincing because you got the right answers not because you did a good job of arguing
- When giving a draft of an essay to friends two things you want to know:
	- What parts are boring?
	- What seems unconvincing?
		- The boring bits can be fixed by cutting but don’t try and fix the unconvincing bits by arguing more cleverly, talk the matter over
- Expressing ideas helps to form them
	- In a real essay you’re writing for yourself, you’re thinking out loud
- Writing something that other people will read forces you to think well; so it does matter to have an audience
- Questions aren’t enough; an essay has to come up with answers
	- An essay you publish ought to tell the reader something he didn’t already know
	- What you tell them doesn’t matter so long as its interesting
- An essay is supposed to be a search for truth
	- It would be suspicious if it didn’t meander
- Of all the places to go next, choose the most interesting
	- Always know generally what you want to write about but not the specific conclusions you want to reach; from paragraph to paragraph let the ideas take their course
- Fundamentally an essay is a train of thought, but a cleaned-up train of thought as dialogue is cleaned-up conversation
	- You need to cut and fill to emphasize the central thread, like an illustrator inking over a pencil drawing
	- But don’t change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the original
- Essays should aim for maximum surprise
- Best way to get information out of people was to ask them what surprised them?
	- Extremely useful question you can ask of the most unobservant people and it will extract information they didn’t even know they were recording
- Surprises are things that you not only didn’t know but that contradict things you thought you know
	- And so they’re the most valuable sort of fact you can get
	- They’re like a food that’s not merely healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things you’ve already eaten
- You should only write about things you’ve thought about a lot
	- And anything you come across that surprises you, who’ve thought about the topic a lot will probably surprise most readers
- Two ingredients for good essay writing
	- Few topics you’ve thought a lot about
	- Some ability to ferret out the unexpected
- Collecting surprises is like learning history
	- The more anomalies you’ve seen the more easily you’ll notice new ones
	- Which means as you grow older life should become more and more surprising
- It’s good to have a habit of asking questions, especially questions beginning with Why
	- Especially useful to ask why about things that seem wrong
- Pay attention to things that seem wrong in a humorous way
	- Surprises make us laugh and surprises are what one wants to deliver
	- Write down things that surprise you
- Whatever you study, include history but social and economic history not political history
	- History is all the data we have so far
	- Studying history also gives one confidence that there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right under our noses
- Above all, make a habit of paying attention to things you’re not supposed to either because they’re inappropriate or not important or not what you’re supposed to be working on
	- If you’re curious about something, trust your instincts
	- Follow the threads that attract your attention; if there’s something you’re really interested in, you’ll have an uncanny way of leading back to it anyway
- Gradualness is very powerful
