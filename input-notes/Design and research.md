**Design and research**

- Design doesn’t have to be new but has to be good
- Research doesn’t need to be good but has to be new
- Best design surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas
- Best research solves problem that are new and worth solving
- Biggest difference is in design you focus more on the user
	- Design begins by asking who is this for and what do they need from it?
- What they need not what they want
- The customer is always right int he sense that the measure of good design is how well it works for the user
- Users are often mistaken about what they really want
- Most likely to get good design if the intended users include the designer himself
	- When designing something for a group that doesn’t include you it tends to be for people you consider to be less sophisticated than you
		- Looking down on the user, however benevolently, inevitably corrupts the designer 
	- If you think you’re designing for idiots, odds are you’re not designing something good, even for idiots
- Even if you’re designing for the most sophisticated of users, you’re still designing for humans
	- Different in research; scientific ideas aren’t meant to be ergonomic
- Design is all about people
	- All the arts have to pander to the interests and limitations of humans
- Brain just as idiosyncratic as body
	- Some ideas easy, some ideas hard
		- Limited capacity for dealing with detail
- To get good design you have to get close to and stay close to your users
- You have to calibrate your ideas on actual users constantly, especially in the beginning
- If building something new, get a prototype in front of users ASAP
- Trying to create the complete finished product in the beginning is a recipe for disaster
- Morale is key in design
	- Building something by gradually refining a prototype is good for morale because it keeps you engaged
		- In software: always have working code
		- If you’re writing something you can test in an hour then you have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate you
- To make something good, you have to be thinking “wow this is really great” not “what a piece of shit; these fools will love it”
- Design usually has to be under the control of a single person to be any good
