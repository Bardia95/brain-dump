**What the bubble got right**
**
**
- Recognizing an important trend turns out to be easier than figuring out how to profit from it
- The mistake investors always seem to make is to take the trend too literally
	- Since the Internet was the big new thing, investor supposed that the more Internettish the company, the better
- Most of the money to be made from big trends is made indirectly
- How big you could grow a company in revenues without ever having more than ten people?
	- What would happen if you outsourced everything except product development?
	- Small groups are intrinsically more productive, because the internal friction of a group grows as the square of its size
- In the coming century, good ideas will count more
- Doing good work will matter more than dressing up or advertising which is the same thing for companies
- People will be rewarded a bit more in proportion to the value of what they create
