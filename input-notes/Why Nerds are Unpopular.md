**Why Nerds are Unpopular**
**
**
- Nerds serve two masters
	- They want to be popular but they want even more to be smart
- Teenagers are always on duty as conformists
	- Example: teenage kids pay a great deal of attention to clothes
		- They don’t consciously dress to popular, they dress to look good but to other kids
		- Other kids’ opinions become their definition of right, not just for clothes, but for almost everything they do, right down to the way they talk
		- So every effort they make to do things right is also an effort to be more popular
- In general, people outside some very demanding field don’t realize the extent to which success depends on constant effort
- The main reason nerds are unpopular is that they have other things to think about
	- Their attention is drawn to books or the natural world, not fashion and parties
- In any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try and emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below
	- This is why poor whites are the group most hostile to blacks in the US
- To become more popular, you need to constantly be doing things that bring you closer tot other popular people and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy
	- Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders
	- Most of the persecution comes from kids lower down, the nervous middle classes
- The inhabitants of school and prison are trapped in little bubbles where nothing they do can have more than a local effect
	- Naturally these societies degenerate into savagery, they have no function for their form to follow
- When the things you do have real effects, it’s no longer enough to just be pleasing, it starts to be important to get the right answers
- In a large enough pool, even the smallest minorities can achieve a critical mass if they clump together
- The suburbs are boring and sterile because they’re a place to have kids; the whole place is a giant nursery, an artificial town created explicitly for the purpose of breeding children
	- Suburbs are deliberately designed to exclude the outside world, because it contains things that could endanger children
- Officially the purpose of schools is to teach kids
	- In fac their primary purpose is to keep kids locked up in one place for a big chunk of the day so adults can get things done
		- In a specialized industrial society, it would be a disaster to have kids running around loose
- The problem is kids aren’t told that they are in prison and that the prison is run by the inmates 
	- Kids are sent off to spend 6 years memorizing meaningless facts in a world ruled by a caste of giants who run after an oblong brown ball as if this were the most natural thing in the world
- Teenagers are crazy because of schools, suburbia, neurotic lapdogism
- In school, there was never anything real to work on
	- Work is identity and work in school is pointless
	- Most often it was arbitrary series of hoops to jump through, words without content designed mainly for testability
- Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society
	- In pre-industrial times they were all apprentices of one sort or another 
	- Teenagers seem to have respected adults more then because the adults were the visible experts in the skills they were trying to learn
	- Now most kids have little idea what their parents do in their distant offices, and see no connection between schoolwork and the work they’ll do as adults
- After a couple years’ training, an apprentice could be a real help
	- Now adults have no immediate use for teenagers
- As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them
	- Teenagers now are useless except as cheap labour in industries like fast food, which evolved to exploit precisely this fact
- The stated purpose of schools is to educate the kids
	- But there is no external pressure to do this well and so most schools do such a bad job of teaching that the kids don’t really take it seriously - not even the smart kids
	- Much of the time we were all, students and teachers both, just going through the motions
- In almost any group of people you’ll find hierarchy
	- When groups of adults form in the real world, it’s generally for some common purpose and the leaders end up being those who are best at it
	- The problem with most schools is they have no purpose but hierarchy there must be and so the kids make one out of nothing
- School degenerates into a popularity contest because instead of depending on some real test, one’s rank depends mostly on one’s ability to increase one’s rank
- When there is some real external test of skill it isn’t painful to be at the bottom of the hierarchy
	- Rookies don’t resent veterans for their skill, he hopes to be like him one day and is happy to have the chance to learn from him
	- Status also depends on how well they do against opponents not on whether they can push the other down
- The mediocrity of American public schools has worse consequences than just making kids unhappy for 6 years; it breeds a rebelliousness that actively drives kids away from the things they’re supposed to be learning
- Misrule breeds rebellion
- The real problem is the emptiness of school life
- School is a strange, artificial thing, half sterile and half feral
	- It’s all-encompassing like life, but it isn’t the real thing
