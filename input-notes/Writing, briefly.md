- Far more important to write well than most people realize
- Writing doesn’t just communicate ideas, it generates them
- Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can
- Rewrite it over and over
- Cut out everything unnecessary
- Write in a conversational tone
- Develop a nose for bad writing
	- So you can see and fix it in yours
- Imitate writers you like
- Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it and 50% of those you start with to be wrong
- Say the most important sentence first
- Write about stuff you like
- Don’t try to sound impressive
- Don’t hesitate to change the topic on the fly
- Use footnotes to contain digressions
- Use anaphora to knit sentences together
- Read your essays out loud
	- See where you stumble over awkward phrases
	- See which bits are boring
- Try to tell the reader something new and useful
- When you restart, begin by rereading what you already have 
- When you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with
- Accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file
- If you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately
- Ask friends which sentence you’ll regret most
- Go back and tone down harsh remarks
- Use simple, germanic words
- Learn to distinguish surprises from digressions
- Learn to recognize the approach of an ending and when one appears, grab it
