**Hackers and Painters**
**
**
- The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way
- Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded
- The best sources of ideas are not the other fields that have the word computer in their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers
- A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you’ve already thought of
- There is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally, rather than problems that are important
- Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software, and its hard for the people running a company to pick these out
	- So instead of entrusting the future of the software to one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed by committee, and the hackers merely implement the design
- If you can figure out a way to get in a design war with a company big enough that its software is designed by product managers, they’ll never be able to keep up with you
- The place to find design wars is in new markets where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications
- That’s where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design and having the same people both design nd implement the product
- Two problems with startups are:
	- 1: much to do besides writing software
	- 2: not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that’s interesting to write
		- If you want to make money you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free
- There is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers
- Let hackers work on open-source projects
- Hackers can learn to program by looking at good programs not just at what they do but the source code too
- Its unrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program will be perfect, you’re better off if you admit this upfront and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly
- There is danger in premature optimization and premature design
	- Deciding too early what a program should do could be its death knell
- Relentlessness wins because in the aggregate, unseen details become visible
	- All those unseen details combine to produce something that’s just stunning
- Great software requires a fanatical devotion to beauty
	- If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too
- In hacking, work comes in cycles
	- Sometimes you get excited about some new project and you want to work 16 hours a day on it and other times nothing seems interesting
- Its a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments you would otherwise stall
- The right way to collaborate is to divide projects into sharply defined modules each with a definite owner and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages
- Hackers must have empathy to do great work; you have to be able to see things from the user’s point of view
- Looking at things from other people’s point of view is practically the secret of success
- To write good software you have to understand how little users understand
	- They’re going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they’re not going to read the manual
- Over and over we see the same pattern:
	- A new medium appears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple of generations
