You’re not meant to have a boss

- Humans are supposed to be in groups of 8 optimally (based on hunter-gatherer)
- Normal jobs are as bad for our brains as sugar is bad for the body
- Working for yourself is better for yourself the same way eating like hunter-gatherers are
- Groups bigger than 20 are very hard to handle
- There is no individual initiative when working for a big company
- If people have to choose between something cheap, heavily marketed, and appealing in the short term vs. something expensive, obscure, and appealing in the long term, most will choose the first option
	- Same with work, most graduates want to work at safe brands they know they will be fine at, drawbacks only appear later and only in a vague sense of malaise
- Bosses/big companies are bad for us in the same way that our modern food is
	- We aren’t supposed to be working in big groups because they are hard to manage and you have less freedom
- Companies use a tree structure to keep small groups in tact but then have a boss represent everyone in that one group as a manager with other managers
	- Problem with this is that managers can’t embody multiple people at once 
- Especially bad for programmers because they do new things every day and create, it sucks the freedom out of them
	- If you aren’t allowed to implement new ideas you stop having them and when you can do whatever you want you have more ideas about what to do
- Work for a small company always, it always sucks to work at a big company
- Best way is to get rid of tree structure is to have independent groups work together like a market system
