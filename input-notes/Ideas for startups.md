**Ideas for startups**

- The main value of your initial idea is that in the process of discovering its broken you’ll come up with your real idea
- The initial idea is just a starting point
- Not a blueprint but a question
	- Instead of saying that your idea is to make a collaborative web-based spreadsheet, say:
		- Could one make a collaborative, web-based spreadsheet?
	- Assertion provokes objections in a way a question doesn’t
		- A question doesn’t seem so challenging; it becomes:
			- Let’s try making a web-based spreadsheet and see how far we get
	- If an idea is a blueprint it has to be right but if its a question it can be wrong so long as its wrong in a way that leads to more ideas
- One valuable way for an idea to be wrong is to be only a partial solution
	- Is there some way to bite off some subset of the problem, then gradually expand fro there?
		- This will generally work
- To generate such questions you need 2 things:
	- To be familiar with promising new technologies
		- Ingredients startup ideas are made of
	- The right kind of friends
		- Conversations with friends are the kitchen they’re cooked in
- Work on things that maximize your future options
- A job that lets you work on exciting new stuff tend to pay less because part of the compensation is in the form of the new skills you’ll learn
- Ideas get developed in the process of explaining them to the right kind of person
	- You need that resistance just as a carver needs the resistance of the wood
- The most productive setup is a kind of together-alone-together sandwich
	- Together you talk about some hard problem, probably getting nowhere
	- Then the next morning one of you has an idea in the shower about how to solve it
	- You run eagerly to tell the others and together you work out the kinks
- Taking a shower is like a form of meditation 
	- You’re alert but theres nothing to distract you
	- Its in a situation like this, where your mind is free to roam that it bumps into new ideas
- Perhaps letting your mind wander is like doodling with ideas
	- You have certain mental gestures you’ve learned in your work and when you’re not paying attention you keep making these same gestures somewhat randomly
		- In effect, you call the same functions on random arguments
		- That’s what a metaphor is: a function applied to an argument of the wrong type
- You’re not just looking for good ideas but good new ideas and you have a better chance of generating those if you combine stuff from distant fields
- Harder fields may be better sources because to attack hard problems you need powerful solvents
	- Math is a good source of metaphors - good enough that it’s worth studying for just for that
- Related fields are also good sources, especially when they’re related in unexpected ways 
- To have good ideas you need to be working on some problem
	- You can’t just start with randomness
	- You need to start with a problem and then let your mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form
- In a way its harder to see problems than their solutions
- Most people prefer to remain in denial about problems because they’re irritating to dwell on
- Recipe: 
	- Finding the problem intolerable and feeling it must be possible to solve it
- One way to make something people want is to look at stuff people use now thats broken
- The way to kill a monopoly is to redefine the problem as a superset of the current one
- Another classic way to make something people want is to take a luxury and make it into a commodity
- If you make something dramatically cheaper you often get qualitative changes, because people start to use it in different ways
	- For example, once computers get so cheap that most people can have one of their own you can use them as communication devices
- Often to make something dramatically cheaper you have to redefine the problem
	- The best way to solve a problem is often to redefine it
- Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general technique
	- Making things easier
		- Making things easier to use
- What you want to be able to say about technology is: it just works
- More options just means more rope to hang yourself
- Take any almost any existing technology produced by a big company and assume you could build something way easier to use
- You need some kind of exit strategy
- Look at big companies, think what they should be doing and do it yourself
	- Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want
		- When there’s only one acquirer, they don’t have to hurry
		- They can take their time and copy you instead of buying you
		- If you want to get market price, work on something where there’s competition
- Best way to generate startup ideas is to do what hackers do for fun:
	- Cook up amusing hacks with your friends
