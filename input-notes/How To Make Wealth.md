**How To Make Wealth**
**
**
- Best bet to get rich is to start or join a startup
- A startup can be defined as a small company that takes on a hard technical problem

*The Proposition*

- Economically, a start up is like compressing an entire career’s worth of work into a few years
	- Instead of low intensity work for 40 years, you go as hard as you can for 4
		- Pays especially well in tech, where there is a premium on fast work
- If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do about $3 million’s worth of work in 1 year
- Conservation law: to make $1 million, you need to endure $1 million worth of pain

*Millions, not billions*

- Large random factor in the success of any company
- Microsoft got lucky with one of the biggest blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS
		- Microsoft had little leverage over IBM, a component supplier essentially, but if IBM had required an exclusive license as they should have, Microsoft still would have been down
- The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich is that its more legitimate, more straightforward
	- Just have to do something people want

*Money is not wealth*

- Wealth is not the same thing as money
	- Wealth is as old as human history
	- Money is relatively recent invention
- Wealth is the fundamental thing; it is the stuff we want:
	- Food, clothes, cars, houses, gadgets, travel, etc.
	- You can have wealth without having money
- Money is a side effect of specialization
	- The solution societies find as they get more specialized is to make trade into a 2 step process
	- Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes you tried violins for silver which you can then trade again for anything else you want/need
		- The intermediate stuff - the medium of exchange - can be anything that’s rare and portable
- The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work
- Disadvantage is that it tends to obscure the real meaning of trade
	- People think that what a business does is make money, but money is just an intermediate stage for whatever people want
	- What businesses really do is make wealth: they do something people want

*The Pie Fallacy *

- A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world
	- Fixed amount of money in a normal family but not same thing
- Wealth often described as a pie where if one person gets more another gets less
	- Not true
	- What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money
		- It is not wealth but something we use to move wealth around
- You can make more wealth
	- Wealth has been getting created and destroyed for all of human history
- Own a beat-up old car
	- Restore that car to pristine condition
		- Created wealth

*Craftsmen*

- Craftsmen are the ones more likely to grasp the idea of wealth creation as they are the ones making things by hand that get sold directly to customers
	- The rise of industrialization has decimated the craftsmen population
- Biggest remaining group of craftsmen is computer programmers
		- A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and create wealth
			- A good piece of software is, in itself, a valuable thing
- There are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created
	- A great programmer could create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks
	- A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs)
- Top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software
- Wealth can be created without being sold
	- Scientists effectively donated the wealth they created

*What a Job is*

- Getting a job seems to mean joining another institution
	- Superficially its a lot like college
	- The deeper you get into the underlying reality the more different it gets
- What a company does and has to do if it wants to continue to exist is earn money
	- The way most companies do this is by creating wealth
	- Nearly all companies exist to do something people want
		- And that’s what you do as well when you go to work for a company
- In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a bunch of other people
	- You may not even be aware you are doing something people want
		- Your contribution may be indirect
- Sometone graduating from college thinks and is told that he needs to get a job as if the important thing were becoming a member of an institution
	- A more direct way to put it:
		- You need to start doing something people want
			- You don’t need to join a company to do that 
			- All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want
				- It’s doing something that people want that matters not joining the group

*Working Harder*

- Averaging gets to be a problem
- Thinks the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person’s work
	- For the most part they punt 
- In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working fairly hard
	- You’re not expected to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you’re not expected to devote your whole life to your work
- There are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work
	- In the right kind of business, someone who really devoted himself to work could generate 10x-100x as much wealth as an average employee
		- Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this
- More serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work
	- Salesmen are an exception as its easy to measure how much revenue they generate and they’re usually paid a percentage of it
		- If a salesman wants to work harder he can just start doing it and he will automatically get paid proportionally more
	- Other exception is top management
		- Performance can be measured
			- Top managers are held responsible for the entire company’s performance 
- A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly would be hugely successful
	- Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it
	- More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard
	- It would crush its competitor
- Unfortunately, companies can’t pay everyone like salesmen as salesmen work alone and most employees’ work is tangled together
	- There’s no way to untangle all their contributions
- If you want to go faster, its a problem to have your work tangled with a large number of other people’s

*Measurement and Leverage*

- To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation where your performance can be measured and you have to have leverage where the decisions you make have a  big effect
	- Ex. Lead actor of movie/CEO/Fund manager
		- Measurement of performance in gross of movie/company/fund
		- Leverage in the sense that your performance/decisions can make or break it
- Good hint to the presence of leverage is possibility of failure
	- Upside must be balanced by downside so if there is big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss
		- If you’re in a job that feels safe you are not going to get rich because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage
- All you need to do is be a part of a small group working on a hard problem

*Smallness = Measurement*

- You can measure the value of the work done by small groups
- When the company is small, you are closer to measuring the contributions of individual employees
- The people you work with had better be good because its their work that yours is going to be averaged with
- A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers
	- 2 things keep the speed of the galley down
		- Individual rowers don’t see any result from working harder
		- In a group of a thousand people, average rower tends to be pretty average
- If you took 10 people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves they could probably go faster
	- They would have both carrot and stick to motivate them
	- Seeing your effort have a visible effect on the speed of the boat is encouraging 
	- If someone was lazy, other would be more likely to notice and complain
- The real advantage of the 10 man boat shows when you take the 10 best rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together
- Because startups tend to get founded by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already know one another the level of measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone
	- A startup is not merely 10 people, but 10 people like you
- Steve Jobs said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first 10 employees
	- If anything its more like the first 5
- The larger a group, the closer its average number will be to the average for the population as a whole
	- All other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others

*Technology = Leverage*

- Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage
	- Allows measurement because of small size and offers leverage because they make money by inventing a new technology
- What is technology? It’s technique
	- Its the way we all do things
		- And when you discover a new way to do things its value is multiplied by all the people who use it
- If you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution
	- That’s leverage
- If you look at history, seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology
- Natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems
	- The leading edge of technology moves fast
		- Small companies are more at home in this world because they don’t have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down
		- Technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches and small companies are less constrained by convention
- Big companies only get to develop technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them
	- Even then, they depend heavily ons startups for components and ideas
- Obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems but thinks that will also found to be true in businesses that don’t seem to be about technology
	- Ex. McDonald’s, Walmart
	- Its coming true
- Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way
	- Deliberately seek hard problems
- Startups have to create barriers to entry
	- Better have a convincing explanation of why your technology would be hard to copy
	- One way is patents but sometimes they don’t provide much protection
		- Competitors often find ways around patents and if they can’t they may just violate and invite you to sue
		- A big company is not afraid to be sued 
- The best defense is a good offence
	- Develop a technology thats simply too hard for competitors to duplicate and you won’t need to rely on other defences
	- Start by picking a hard problem and then at every decision point, take the harder choice

*The Catches*

- You can’t just choose to work 3x as hard to make 3x as much money
	- Competitors force you to have to work as hard as you possibly can
- Payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity
	- Large random multiplier to success of any company
- Common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money and have to shut down
- Startups are an all-or-nothing proposition
- A company big enough to acquire startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late
	- They would rather overpay for a safe choice
	- It is easier to sell an established startup even at a large premium than an early-stage one

*Get Users*

- Get bought if you can
	- Running a business is different from growing one
	- Financially wise, because selling allows you to diversify
- Getting bought is also an art in it’s own right
	- Potential buyers will always delay of they can
		- Hard part of getting bought is getting them to act
	- For most, biggest motivator is not hope of gain but fear of loss
		- For potential acquirers, biggest motivator is prospect that one of their competitors will buy you
		- Second biggest worry is that if they don’t buy you now you’ll cost more to acquire late or even become a competitor
			- Both cases come down to users
				- Acquirers go by the number of users you have
				- They assume the customers know who has the best technology
				- Users are the only real proof that you’ve created wealth
- VCs have a list of danger signs to watch out for
	- 1 of the biggest is a company run by techno-weenies obsessed with solving interesting technical problems instead of making users happy
- Make users the test
	- Treat a startup as an optimization problem in which performance is measured by number of users
	- Key is
