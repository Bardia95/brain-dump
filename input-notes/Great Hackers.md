**Great Hackers**

- Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity
	- Almost certainly a good thing:
		- If a society has no variation in productivity its not because everyone’s a genius inventor its because no ones a genius inventor
	- Low-tech societies don’t show much variation in productivity
		- Collecting sticks - you can only be better than another by a small factor
		- Complex tools like computers - variation in what you can do much greater
- Its hard deciding what problems to solve
	- Imagination is hard to measure, but in practice it dominates the kind of productivity thats measured in lines of code
- Productivity varies in any field, but there are a few in which it varies a lot
	- Variation between programmers is so great that it becomes a difference in kind
- In every field, technology magnifies differences in productivity
	- In programming, there’s a lot of technological leverage
	- But in every field, the lever is getting longer, so the variation we see is something that more and more fields will see as time goes on
	- The success of companies and countries will depend increasingly on how they deal with it
- If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the contribution of the most productive individuals will not only be disproportionately large, but will actually grow with time
	- When you reach the point where 90% of a group’s output is created by 1% of its members, you lose big if something drags their productivity down to the average
- Defining quality of super-hackers is probably that they really love to program
	- All they really care about is doing interesting work
- A great programmer might be 10-100x more productive as an ordinary one, but he’ll consider himself lucky to get paid 3x as much
- Hackers like good tools
	- They find it unbearable to use bad tool
	- They’ll simply refuse to work on projects with the wrong infrastructure
- When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you’re not just making a technical decision, you’re also making a social decision
	- When you choose a language, you’re also choosing a community
	- Quality of your hackers probably matters more than the language you choose
- Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software
	- It gives them more control
		- Hackers insist on more control
- Any application can be interesting if it poses novel technical challenges
- A good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a more interesting one
- Hackers like to work for people with high standards
- To drive design, a manager must be the most demanding user of a company’s products
- Working on nasty little problems makes you stupid
- If your company makes software to do x, have one group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and another that uses these tools to write the applications
	- This way you might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code, but still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would be in a traditional research department
	- The toolmakers would have users, but they’d only be the company’s own developers
- Great hackers tend to clump together
- A company that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage
- Great hackers: Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, Alan Kay
- They key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like
- To do something well you have to love it
- Hackers are particularly curious especially about how things work
- Hackers’ ability to concentrate is amazing
- Great hackers can load a large amount of context into their head, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just that line but the whole program around it
- Recipe to become a great hacker:
	- Never work on boring projects and you will never allow yourself to do a half-assed job
