Stuff

- Stuff has gotten a lot cheaper but our attitudes toward it haven’t changed correspondingly
	- We overvalue stuff
- The value of some new acquisition isn’t the difference between its retail price and what you pay for it
	- Its the value you derive from it
- Unless you have some plan for selling that valuable thing you got so cheaply, what difference does it make what it’s worth?
- The only way you’re ever going to extract any value from it is to use it
	- And if you don’t have any immediate use for it, you probably never will
- Treat stuff as worthless
	- In fact, worse than worthless, because once you’ve accumulated a certain amount of stuff, it start to own you rather than the other way around
- Unless you’re extremely organized, a house full of stuff can be very depressing
	- A cluttered room saps one’s spirits
		- Humans constantly scan their environment to build a mental model of what’s around them
		- The harder a scene is to parse, the less energy you have left for conscious thoughts
- Ask yourself before buying something, “is this going to make my life noticeably better?”
	- Will this be something I use constantly or is it just something nice or worst still a mere bargain?
- The worst stuff in this respect may be stuff you don’t use much because its too good
	- Nothing owns you like fragile stuff
- Another way to resist acquiring stuff is to think of the overall cost of owning it
	- The purchase price is just the beginning
		- You’re going to have to think about that thing for years or more
- Everything you own takes energy away from you, some give more than they take, those are the only things worth having
- If you want to spend money on some kind of treat, take services over goods any day
- A historical change has taken place
	- Stuff used to be valuable and now its not
