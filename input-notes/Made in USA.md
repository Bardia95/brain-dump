- Americans are good at making movies and software and bad at making cars and cities
- In software, good craftsmanship means working fast
	- If you work slow and meticulously, you merely end up with a  very fine implementation of your initial mistaken idea
	- Working slowly and meticulously is premature optimization
		- Better to get a prototype done fast and see what new ideas it gives you
- With physical products there are more constraints and you don’t win by dramatic innovations so much as by good taste and attention to detail
- The problem with American cars is bad design and you can see it by just looking at the,
	- Japanese make better cars because their culture prizes design and craftsmanship
- What Americans like is speed and they’re willing to do something in an ugly way to get it done fast
	- In fields like software and movies this is a net win
		- Its not just that they are malleable mediums, in those businesses the designers have more power
- American car companies try to make what marketing people think consider cars
- In the long term it pays to bet on good design
- For something to surprise you it must be satisfying expectations you didn’t know you had
- Perhaps the most successful countries in the future will be those most willing to ignore what are considered national characters and do each kind of work in the way that works best
