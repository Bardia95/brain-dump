Why startups condense in America

- Startups happen in clusters
- **The US allows immigration**
- **The US is a rich country**
	- There is some speed limit to the evolution of an economy
	- Economies are made out of people and attitudes can only change a certain amount per generation
- **The US is not yet a police state**
- **You can fire people in America**
	- Across industries and countries, there’s a strong inverse correlation between performance and job security
- **In America work is less identified with employment**
	- The less you identify work with employment, the easier it becomes to start a startup
	- When you see your career as a series of different types of work, instead of a lifetime’s service to a single employer, there’s less risk in starting your own company, because you’re only replacing one segment instead of discarding the whole thing
- **America is not too fussy**
	- The worst problem in other countries is probably the effort required just to start a company
	- Tip for governments that want to encourage startups:
		- Read the stories of existing startups, and then try to simulate what would have happened in your country
			- When you hit something that would have killed Apple, prune it off
	- Young startups are fragile and a society that trims its margins will sharply kill them all
- **America has a large domestic market**
	- In a small country, a startup has a harder task: they have to sell internationally from the start
- **America has venture funding**
	- Startups-VC pattern makes them startup hubs
	- The cycle is slow, taking 5 years before a startup founder can make angel investments
	- Another advantage of private universities is that a good chunk of the country’s wealth is managed by enlightened investors
- **America has dynamic typing for careers**
	- Startups are the kind of thing people don’t plan, so you’re more likely to get them in a society where its ok to make career decisions on the fly
	- Perhaps America’s lousy public schools have a hidden advantage, because they’re so bad, the kids adopt an attitude of waiting for college
	- Better to make everyone feel like a late bloomer than a failed child prodigy
- **Attitudes **
	- In the US, it’s ok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it’s not
- **How to do better**
	- Be interesting itself
	- Public transportation
	- The kind of people you want to attract to your silicon valley like to get around by train, bicycle and on foot
- **Capital gains**
	- Have lower capital gains taxes
	- If capital gains vary, you move assets, not yourself, so changes are reflected at market speeds
	- The lower the rate, the cheaper it is to buy stock in growing companies as opposed to real estate, bonds or stocks bought for the dividends they pay
	- Politics is a matter of choosing between the unpalatable and the disastrous
- **Immigration**
	- Smarter immigration policy
	- If you made a competing technology hub that let in all smart people, you’d immediately get more than half the world’s top talent, for free
	- American immigration policy keeps out most smart people and channels the rest into unproductive jobs
	- Treat immigration like recruiting - seek out the smartest people and get them to come to your country
	- A country that got immigration right would have a huge advantage
		- At this point you could become a mecca for smart people simply by having an immigration system that let them in
