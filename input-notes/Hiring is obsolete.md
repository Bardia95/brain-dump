**Hiring is obsolete**
**
**
- Most startups that succeed do it by getting bought
	- And usually the acquirer doesn’t just want the technology but the people who created it as well
- When a startup gets bought for 2-3 million six months in, its really more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition
- Disruptive technologies are developed by disruptive people
- There are too many new ideas for companies to explore them all
- What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they’re young before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs hundreds of millions to acquire
- When companies buy startups they’re effectively fusing recruiting and product development
	- This method is more efficient and yields teams of developers who already work well together
- Most undergrads don’t realize yet that the economic cage is open
	- A lot have been told by their parents that the route to success is to get a good job
	- The route to success is to build something valuable and you don’t have to be working for an existing company to do that
	- You can often do it better if you’re not
- If you’re young you should take the riskiest investments you can find
- Your early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks
	- Riskier career moves pay better on average because there is less demand for them
	- Its not necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance of failing if you can afford the risk
- If you start a startup right out of college and it tanks, you’ll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter
	- Everyone prefers the guy who tried starting his own company over the guy working at a big firm
- The end of school is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from net consumer to net producer
- The other big change is that now, you’re steering
	- It may be worth standing back and understanding what’s going on, instead of just doing the default thing
- All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads have been thinking about what employers want
	- But what really matters is what customers want, because they’re the ones who give employers the money to pay you
	- Better off thinking directly about what users want
- The big change that experience causes in your brain is learning that you need to solve people’s problems
