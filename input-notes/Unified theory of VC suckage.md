**Unified theory of VC suckage**

- Only reason VCs are so sneaky is the giant deals they do
	- With so much at stake, they have to be devious
- VCs don’t invest  $x million because that’s how much you need, but because thats the amount the structure of their business requires them to invest
- You can’t benefit from a high valuation unless you can somehow achieve what those in the business call a “liquidity event” and the higher your valuation, the narrower your options for doing that
