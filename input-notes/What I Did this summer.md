**What I Did this summer**
**
**
- A startup depends mainly on how smart and energetic you are
- All worked ridiculously hard
- Young people seem lazy because the work they’re given is pointless, and they act irresponsible because they’re not given any power
- As hard as people millwork for money, they’ll work harder for a cause
- Competitors are rarely as dangerous as they seem
- The primary function of software in a startup: to be a vehicle for experimenting with its own design
- Startups can be irresponsible and release version 1s that are light enough to evolve
	- In big companies, all the pressure is in the direction of over-engineering
- If investors get too involved, they smother one of the most powerful forces in a startup: the feeling that its your own company
- Incubators are a bad idea
	- They fail because they select for the wrong people
