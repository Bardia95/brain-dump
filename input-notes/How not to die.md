How not to die

- If you can just avoid dying, you get rich
- Having dinners every Tuesday with YC and other founders causes you to get more done that you would otherwise because every dinner is a mini Demo Day
	- Every dinner is a kind of deadline
		- So the mere constraint of staying in regular contact with us will push you to make things happen, because otherwise you’ll be embarrassed to tell us that you haven’t done anything new since the last time we talked
- Underlying cause of death is usually that they’ve become demoralized
- If you know it’s going to feel terrible sometimes then when it feels terrible you won’t think “ouch, this feels terrible I give up”
	- It feels that way for everyone and if you just hang on things will probably get better
- The feeling that what you’re doing isn’t working is frequent
- The number one thing not to do is other things
