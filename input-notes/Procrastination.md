**Procrastination**

- The most impressive people PG knows are all terrible procrastinators
- The question is not how to avoid procrastination but to procrastinate well
- Three variants of procrastination
	- Working on nothing
	- Working on something less important
	- Working on something more important
- Good procrastination is avoiding errands to do real work
- The reason it pays to put off even those errands is that real work need two things that errands don’t”
	- Big chunks of time
	- The right mood
- If you get inspired by some project, it can be a net win to blow off everything you were supposed to do for the next few days to work on it
- There may be types of work that can only be done in long, uninterrupted stretches, when inspiration hits, rather than dutifully in scheduled little slices
- Forcing someone to perform errands synchronously is bound to limit their productivity
- The cost of an interruption is not just the time it takes but that it breaks the time on either side in half
	- You probably only have to interrupt someone a couple times a day before they’re unable to work on hard problems at all
- The most dangerous form of procrastination is unacknowledged type-B procrastination because it doesn’t feel like procrastination
	- You’re getting things done just the wrong things
- Any advice about procrastination that concentrates on crossing things off your to-do list is not only incomplete but positively misleading if it doesn’t consider the possibility that to-do list itself is a form of type-B procrastination
	- Nearly everyone’s is
	- Unless you’re working on the biggest things you could be working on, you’re type B procrastinating, no matter how much you’re getting done
- 3 questions
	- What are the most important problems in your field?
	- Are you working on them?
	- Why not?
- What’s the best thing you could be working on and why aren’t you?
- It’s easier to get yourself to work on small problems than big ones
	- One reason is that you  may not get any reward in the foreseeable future
- Another reason people don’t work on big projects is fear of wasting time
- Big problems are terrifying; theres almost a physical pain in facing them
- You have to be facing the big problem directly enough that you catch some of the excitement radiating from it, but not so much that it paralyzes you
- If you want to work on big things, you seem to have to trick yourself into doing it
	- You have to work on small things that could grow into big things or work on successively larger things or split the moral load with collaborators
- The way to solve the problem of procrastination is to let delight pull you instead of making a to-do list to push you
	- Work on an ambitious project you really enjoy, and sail as close to the wind as you can and you’ll leave the right things undone
