Two Kinds of Judgement

- Two different ways people judge you
	- Sometimes judging you correctly is the end goal
	- But there’s a second much more common type of judgement where it isn’t
- The first type of judgement, the type where judging you is the end goal, include court cases, grades in classes, and most competitions
	- Nearly all judgements made on children are of this type, so we get into the habit early in life of thinking that all judgements are
- Judging you is usually only a means to something else
	- These include college admissions, hiring and investment decisions, and the judgements made in dating
		- This kind of judgement is not really about you
	- It’s not aimed at producing a correct estimate of any given individual, but at selecting a reasonably optimal set
- One thing that leads us astray is that the selector seems to be in a position of power
	- That makes him seem like a judge
- Our early training and our self-centredness combine to make us believe that every judgement of us is about us
	- In fact, most aren’t
- This is a rare case where being less self-centred will make people more confident
	- Once you realize how little most people judging you care about judging you accurately - once you realize that because of the normal distribution of most applicant pools, it matters least to judge accurately in precisely the cases where judgement has the most effect - you won’t take rejection so personally
- The more you realize that most judgements are greatly influenced by random, extraneous factors - that most people judging you are more like a fickle novel buyer than a wise and perceptive magistrate - the more you realize you can do things to influence the outcome
