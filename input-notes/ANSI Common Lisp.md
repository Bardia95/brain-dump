**ANSI Common Lisp**

**
**
* Lisp is designed to evolve
* You can use Lisp to define new Lisp operators
* As new abstractions become popular, they are easy to implement in Lisp
* Programming languages teach you not to want what they don’t have
	* You have to think in a language to write code in it, and it’s hard to want something you can’t describe
* Lisp programs are expressed as Lisp data structures so you can write programs that write other programs
* You work bottom-up and top down in Lisp
* The more complex the program, the more valuable bottom-up approach becomes
	* Bottom-up programs can be written in a series of layers, each one acting as a kind of programming language for the one above it
* Working bottom-up is also the best way to get re-usable software; the essence of which is separating general from specific (bottom-up makes this separation)
