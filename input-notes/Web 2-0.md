- Never make users register unless you need to in order to store something from them
- If you do make users register, never make them wait for a confirmation link in an email: in fact, don’t even ask for their email address unless you need it for some reason
- Don’t ask them unnecessary questions
- Never send them email unless they explicitly ask for it
- Never frame pages you link to, or open them in new windows
- If you have a free version and a pay version, don’t make the free version too restricted
- If you find yourself asking “should we allow users to do x?” just answer “yes” whenever you’re unsure
	- Err on the side of generosity
- Let users do what they want
	- If you don’t and your competitor does, you’re in trouble
- The ultimate way to be nice to users is to give them something for free that competitors charge for
- If you can figure out a way to turn a billion dollar industry into a 50 million dollar industry, so much the better, if all 50 million go to you
- Try to figure out what’s going to happen and arrange to be standing there when it does
	- That’s the way to approach technology and as business includes an ever larger technological component, the right way to do business
