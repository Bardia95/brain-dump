The Pooled-Risk Company Management Company

- A management company to manage your company
- They could insure their returns by pooling risk 
- Would offer maximum freedom and security
- Trade in stocks of your company for shares of a new kind of stock of the management company which has the revenues of all the companies the manage
- Public acquirers are structurally identical to pooled-risk management companies but don’t think of themselves that way
	- They are like Benjamin Graham’s Mr. Market
