**Taste for Makers**
**
**
- A lot of people think taste is subjective
	- They think that their thoughts are a tangle of unexamined impulses
		- Most of us are taught as kids to leave this tangle unexamined
		- After telling you that taste is merely a matter of personal preference, they tell you how Da Vinci is an objectively great artist
- Trouble is that taste is not just personal preference
- Whatever job people do, they naturally want to do it better
	- Matter of pride and pleasure
- As you continue to design things you’ll get better at it
	- Your taste will change
	- You will know you are getting better
		- Showing that your old taste was worse
- After acknowledging there is good and bad you can start studying design in detail
	- How has your taste changed?
	- What caused your mistakes?
	- What have other people learned about design?
- **Good design is simple**
	- When you’re forced to be simple, you’re forced to face the real problem
		- When you can’t deliver ornament, you have to deliver substance
- **Good design is timeless**
	- A way to make yourself find the best answer:
		- If you can imagine someone surpassing you, you should do it yourself
	- Also a way to avoid the grip of fashion
		- If you make something that will look good far in the future, its appeal must derive from merit more than fashion
	- if you want to make something that will appeal to future generations, one way is to try and appeal to past generations
		- Hard to predict future, but sure it will be like the past in caring nothing for present fashions
			- If it appeals to people today and in 1500s it will probably in 2500
- **Good design solves the right problem**
	- A lot of bad design is industrious but misguided
		- Example: sans-serif fonts resembling underlying letterform but less legible
	- Problems can be improved as well
- **Good design is suggestive**
	- A building or object should let you use it how you want
	- In software, this means giving users a few basic elements that they can combine as they wish
- **Good design is often slightly funny**
	- Humour is related to strength
		- To have a sense of humour is to be strong
			- Keeping a sense of humour means shrugging off misfortunes and to lose one’s sense of humour is to be wounded by them
		- Good design may not have to be funny but its hard to imagine something that could be called humourless also being good design
- **Good design is hard**
	- Good pain vs. bad pain
		- Need difficult problems not fickle clients or unreliable materials
	- Form should follow function
- **Good design looks easy**
	- Appearance of ease comes with practice
		- Your unconscious mind handles tasks that used to require conscious thought
- **Good design uses symmetry**
	- Repetition and recursion
	- Recursion is a big win in math and engineering
		- Inductive proofs are wonderfully short
		- In software a recursion solution to a problem is the best one
	- Danger of symmetry is that it can be used in place of thought
- **Good design resembles nature**
	- Nature has had a long time to work on problems so its a good sign when your answer resembles nature’s
	- Its not cheating to copy
	- We can also imitate nature’s process with algorithms
- **Good design is redesign**
	- It takes confidence to throw away work
	- You have to think there’s more where that came from
	- People often convince themselves mediocre work is good out of fear it will turn out worse
	- You should cultivate dissatisfaction
	- Mistakes are natural and should be easy to acknowledge and easy to fix instead of being treated as a disaster
	- It helps to have a medium that makes change easy
- **Good design can copy**
	- Unknowing imitation is almost a recipe for bad design
	- The ambitious are not content to imitate
	- The second phase int he growth of taste is a conscious attempt at originality
	- The greatest masters achieve a kind of selflessness
		- They just want the right answer and if part of that answer has been discovered by someone else already that’s not a reason not to use it
		- Confident enough to take from anyone without feeling their own vision will be lost in the process
- **Good design is often strange**
	- Don’t squash it if strangeness starts to appear
		- Can’t cultivate it
	- Trying to make good things inevitably results in a distinctive way
	- The only style worth having is one you can’t help
	- No shortcut to strangeness
- **Good design happens in chunks**
	- Nothing more powerful than a community of talented people working on related problems
	- Great work comes disproportionately from a few hotspots
	- At any given time, there are a few hot topics and a few groups doing great work on them and its nearly impossible to do good work yourself if you’re too far removed from one of these centres 
- **Good design is often daring**
	- Today’s experimental error is tomorrow’s new theory
	- If you want to discover great new things pay particular attention to places where conventional wisdom and truth don’t quite meet
	- Its easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty
		- Most beautiful things come from fixing ugly things
		- Great work usually seems to happen because someone sees something and thinks they can do better than that
	- Intolerance for ugliness is not in itself enough
		- Have to understand a field well before you can develop a good sense for what needs fixing
	- **Recipe for great work is: very exacting taste plus the ability to gratify it **
