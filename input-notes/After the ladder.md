**After the ladder**
**
**
- 30 years ago, one was supposed to work one’s way up the corporate ladder, that’s less the rule now
- This shift to startups has created the appearance of a rapid increase in economic inequality
- Economic statistics are misleading because they ignore the value of safe jobs
	- An easy job from which one can’t be fired is worth money
- In practice, socialist countries have nontrivial disparities of wealth, because they usually have a class of very powerful bureaucrats who are paid mostly by seniority and can never be fired
- A position on the corporate ladder was genuinely valuable because big companies tried not to fire people and promoted within based largely on seniority
- One reason it was profitable to carve up 1980s companies and sell them for parts was that they hadn’t formally acknowledged their implicit debt to employees who had done good work and expected to be rewarded with high-paying executive jobs when their time came
- It seems a bad plan to treat jobs as rewards
	- The old system meant people had to deal with a lot more corporate politics in order to protect the work they’d invested in a position on the ladder
- The big disadvantage of the new system is that involves more risk
- The new model seems more liquid and more efficient but it is less of a financial change than one might think
