Cities and Ambition

- Great cities attract ambitious people
- Most people who did great things were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was done at the time
- You get discouraged when no one around you cares about the same things you do
- Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition
- Not all cities send a message
	- Only those that are centres for some type ambition do
- The complete list of messages I’ve picked up from cities is:
	- Wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of life
- What cities provide is an audience and a funnel for peers
	- These aren’t so critical in something like math or physics where no audience matters except your peers
	- It’s in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the larger environment matters 
		- It’s in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city:
			- You need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of work you do and since you have to find peers for yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city
- The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones of your career
- Your best bet is probably to try living in several places when you’re young
