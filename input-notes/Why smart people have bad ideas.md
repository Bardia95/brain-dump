**Why smart people have bad ideas**
**
**
- The biggest cause of bad ideas is the still life effect
	- You come up with a random idea, plunge into it and at each point feel you’ve put so much time into it that it must be the idea
	- Realize that having invested time in something doesn’t make it good
	- Plunge in by all means but remember later to look at your idea in the harsh light of the morning and ask: is the something people will pay for?
- Going into business is like a hang-glider launch: you’d better do it wholeheartedly or not at all
- If you’re starting a company that will do something cool, the aim better be to make money and maybe be cool, not to be cool and maybe make money
	- It’s hard enough to make money that you can’t do it by accident
	- Unless its your first priority its unlikely to happen at all
- To make grading efficient, everyone has to solve the same problem and that means it has to be decided in advance
	- It would be great if schools taught students how to choose problems as well as how to solve them
- Compared to the sort of problems hackers are used to solving, giving customers what they want is easy
	- Anyone who can write an optimizing compiler can design a UI that doesn’t confuse users, once they choose to focus on that problem
	- And once you apply that kind of brain power to petty but profitable questions, you can create wealth very rapidly
- The essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that’s beneath them
- A hacker who has learned what to make and not just how to make is extraordinarily powerful and not just at making money
- It’s much easier to sell services than a product but the margins are greater on products
- Watch people who have money to spend, see what they’re wasting their time on, cook up a solution, and try selling it to them
	- It’s surprising how small a problem can be and still provide a profitable market for a solution
