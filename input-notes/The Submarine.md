**The Submarine**

- PR is the news equivalent of search engine optimization
	- Instead of buying ads, which readers ignore, you get yourself injected directly into the stories
- Reporters like definitive statements
- Feed the same story to several different publications at once and when readers see similar stories in multiple places, they think there is some important trend afoot
- Trend articles are almost always the work of PR firms
	- With trend stories, PR firms usually line up one or more experts to talk about the industry generally
- Search for a few key phrases and the names of the clients and the experts and youâ€™ll turn up other variants of the same story
- If you really want to be a critical reader, take a step back one step further and ask not just whether the author is telling the truth but why is he writing about this subject at all**
