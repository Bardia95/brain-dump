The List of N Things

- In a list of n things, the work is done for you, its structure is an exoskeleton
- As well as being explicit, the structure is guaranteed to be of the simplest type possible: a few main points with few to no subordinate ones, and no particular connection between them
- Because the main points are unconnected, the list of n things is random access
- There’s no thread of reasoning you have to follow
	- You could read the list in any order
- And because the points are independent of one another, they work like watertight components in an unsinkable ship
	- If you get bored with, or can’t understand, or don’t agree with one point, you don’t have to give up on the article
		- You can just abandon that one and skip to the next
- A list of n things is parallel and therefore fault-tolerant
- There are times when this format is what a writer wants
	- One is obviously when what you have to say is actually a list of n things
- The list of n things is easier for writers as well as readers
	- A real essay is a train of thought and some trains of thought just peter out
- Writing a list of n things is so relaxing
- Because the list of n things is easier for writers too, its not always a damning sign when readers prefer it
- The list of n things similarly limits the damage that can be done by a bad writer
- Because the list of n things is the easiest essay form, it should be a good one for beginning writers
- Three is one case where the list of n things is a dishonest format: when you use it to attract attention by falsely claiming the list is an exhaustive one
- The greatest weakness of the list of n things is that theres so little room for new thought
	- The main point of essay writing when done right, is the new ideas you have while doing it
		- A real essay, as the name implies is dynamic: you don’t know what you’re doing to write when you start
		- It will be about whatever you discover in the course of writing it
		- This can only happen in a very limited way in a  list of n things
			- You make the title first and that’s what its going to be about
			- You can’t have more new ideas in the writing than will fit in the watertight compartments you set up initially 
				- And your brain seems to know this: because you don’t have room for new ideas you don’t have them
