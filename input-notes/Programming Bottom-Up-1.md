**Programming Bottom-Up**

**
**
- The functional elements of a program should not be too big; it makes it hard to read, test and debug
- Large programs must be divided into pieces, and the bigger it is, the more it needs to be divided
	- Normally there is a top down approach to dividing the pieces
		- Ex. 7 main functions = 7 sections, divided further and further
			- Each section of code is big enough to do something substantial but small enough to be understood on its own
- With a bottom up approach - you are changing the language to fit the problem
	- You end up with clear small and efficient code
	- Promotes code re-use
	- It helps clarify your ideas about the design of the program as it makes you always not he lookout for patterns in the code
- Lisp gives broad powers and augmenting the language plays a disproportionately large role in Lisp-style programming
	- Whole different way of programming
	- Extends limit of potential in small groups of code
- Lisp background
	- 2nd oldest high-level programming language
	- Common Lisp and Scheme remain as the only two popular dialects
