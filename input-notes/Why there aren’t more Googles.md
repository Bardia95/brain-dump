Why there aren’t more Googles

- The reason there aren’t more Googles isn’t that investors encourage innovative startups to sell out, but that they won’t even fund them
- “Don’t worry about people stealing your ideas, if your ideas are any good, you’ll have to ram them down people’s throats”
- Most VCs are driven by consensus, not just within their firms, but within the VC community
	- The biggest factor determining how a VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it
		- This algorithm guarantees they’ll miss all the very best ideas
		- The more people who have to like a new idea, the more outliers you lose
- Stupidity equals opportunity
- There aren’t enough investors who will give $200k to a startup that seems very promising but still has some things to figure out
- VCs are money managers
	- They’re looking for ways to put large sums to work, but the startup world is evolving away from their current model
- Startups have gotten cheaper
	- That means they want less money, but also that there are more of them
	- So you can still get large returns on large amounts of money; you just have to spread it more broadly
