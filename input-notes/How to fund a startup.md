**How to fund a startup**
**
**
- The worst problems you’ll face as a startup will be due to investors, not competitors
- Managing investors is one of the most important skills founders need to learn
- The best sort of job is a consulting project in which you can build whatever software you wanted to sell as a startup
	- Then you can gradually transform yourself from a consulting company into a product company and have your clients pay your development expenses
- Custom work doesn’t scale
- The trouble with consulting is that clients have an awkward habit of calling you on the phone
- You have to be very disciplined if you take the consulting route
	- You have to work actively to prevent your company from growing into a weed tree dependent on this source of easy but low-margin money
- Fear of failure is an extraordinary powerful force
	- You won’t have it driving you if your stated ambition is merely to start a consulting company that you will one day morph into a startup
- An advantage of consulting as a way to develop a product is that you know you’re making something at least one customer wants
- Contacts and advice from angel investors can be more important than the money 
- They’ll only consider companies that have an exit strategy - get bought or go public
- If you’re going to sell cheap stock to eminent angels, do it early, when its natural for a company to have a low valuation
- One of the dangers of taking investments from individual angels, rather than through an angel group or investment firm, is that they have less reputation to protect
	- Angels have a corresponding advantage however:
		- They’re also not bound by all the rules that VC firms are
- The best way to find angel investors is through personal introductions
- The angel asks his lawyer to create a vanilla agreement and the terms end up being whatever the lawyer considers vanilla
	- Which in practical terms means whatever existing agreement he finds lying around his firm
	- These heaps of boilerplate are a problem for small startups because they tend to grow into the union of all preceding documents
		- One solution is to have the startup’s lawyer produce the agreement
- The only leverage you have is competition
	- No one wants yo buy you until someone else wants to buy you and then everyone wants to buy you
- The key to closing deals is never to stop pursuing alternatives
- There is a very sharp drop-off in performance among VC firms because in the VC business both success and failure are self-perpetuating
- The lower-tier VC firms are a bargain for founders because they are much hungrier for deals they get better terms from them
- The name of your VC stops mattering once you have some performance to measure
- When a VC offers you a term sheet ask how many of their last 10 term sheets turned into deals
	- This will at least force them to lie outright if they want to mislead you
- Do the extra work of getting personal introductions
- You approach VCs when you can convince them
- Proceed deliberately and question anything that seems odd
- Seed round
	- For a startup, cheapness is power
	- Spend little and work fast
	- The five fundamental questions of a business plan:
		- What they’re going to do
		- Why users need it
		- How large the market is
		- How they’ll make money
		- Who the competitors are and why this company is going to beat them
	- If you have to choose between spending  time on the demo or the business plan, spend most on the demo
		- Software is not only more convincing but a better way to explore ideas
- Series A Round
	- They all ask the same question:
		- Who else have you pitched to?
			- VCs are like high school girls: they’re acutely aware o their position in the VC pecking order, and their interest in a company is a function of the interest other VCs show in it
- Deals fall through
	- Be prepared
- In starting a startup, as in any really bold undertaking, merely deciding to do it gets you halfway there
	- On the day of the race, most of the other runners won’t show up
