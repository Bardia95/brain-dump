**Beating the averages**

- Viaweb - plan to write software that would let end users build online web stores
	- First web-based application
	- Written in Lisp
- The truly serious hacker should learn Lisp
	- Experience with Lisp will make you a better programmer
- Software is an extremely competitive business that is prone to natural monopolies
	- A company that gets software written faster and better will put its competitors out of business
- Start-ups are all or nothing propositions
	- Bet on the wrong tech and the competitor will crush you
- When choosing technology, ignore what others are doing, and consider only what works best
	- Start-ups can’t do what all other startups are doing
		- If you do everything the average start-up does, expect average performance
		- Better do something odd or else you’ll be in trouble
- With web-based software, you can use whatever language you want
- In business, there is nothing more valuable than a technical advantage your competitors don’t understand
	- Surprise is worth as much as force
	- A startup should give its competitors as little information as possible
- Programming languages vary in power
- It is a mistake to program in anything but the most powerful one
	- Exceptions:
		- If you’re writing a program that has to work very closely with a program in a certain language
		- If it only has to do something very simple
		- If you’re writing a short throw-away program use the language with the best library functions for the task
- Many languages have a macro, Lisp has unique macros related to parentheses
- Lisp is the strongest/most powerful language on the continuum
- Lisp code is made from Lisp data objects
	- After its read by the parser, its made of data structures you can traverse
- Lisp has no syntax
	- You write programs in the parse trees that get generated within the compiler when other languages get parsed
	- But these parse trees are fully accessible to your program
		- You can write programs that manipulate them
			- These programs are called macros in Lisp (programs that write programs)
- Programming languages aren’t just tech but what programmers think in
	- Half tech, half religion
	- Median language changes very slowly
- Handy tip for evaluating competitors is their job listings:
	- Job listings have to be specific about what they want or they’ll get the wrong candidates
	- The more of an IT flavour the job description has the less dangerous the company is
