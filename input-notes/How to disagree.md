How to disagree

- **0**
	- Lowest form of disagreement
	- “The author is a self-important dilettante” is really nothing more than a pretentious version of “u r a fag”
- **1 Ad Hominem**
	- Saying that an author lacks the authority to write about a topic is a variant of ad hominem - and a particularly useless sort, because good ideas often come from outsiders
- **2 Responding to tone**
	- Start to see responses to the writing, rather than the writer, the lowest form of these is to disagree with the author’s tone
- **3 Contradiction**
	- Lowest form of response to an argument is simply to state the opposing case with little or no supporting evidence
- **4 Counterargument**
	- Contradiction plus reasoning and/or evidence
- **5 Refutation**
	- To refute something you probably have to quote them
	- You have to find a “smoking gun”, a passage in whatever you disagree with that you feel is mistaken and then explain why its mistaken
- **6 Refuting the central point**
	- The most powerful form of disagreement is to refute someone’s central point
	- Truly effective refutation looks like:
		- The author’s main point seems to be x. As he says “quotation” but this is wrong for reasons x, y, z, etc.
	- The greatest benefit of disagreeing well is not just that it will make conversations better, but that it will make the people who have them happier
		- You don’t have to be mean when you have a real point to make
			- In fact, you don’t want to
			- If you have something real to say, being mean just gets in the way
