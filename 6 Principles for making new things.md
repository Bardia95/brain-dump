6 Principles for making new things

- Find simple solutions to overlooked problems that actually need to be solved and deliver them as informally as possible, starting with a very crude version 1, then iterating rapidly
- Like a contrarian investment fund, someone following this strategy will almost always be doing things that seem wrong to the average person
	- This technique is successful in the long term because it gives you all the advantages other people forgo by trying to seem legit
	- If you work on overlooked problems, you’re more likely to discover new things, because you have less competition
	- If you deliver solutions informally, you save all the effort you would have had to expend to make them look impressive and avoid the danger of fooling yourself as well as your audience
	- And if you release a crude version 1 then iterate, your solution can benefit from the imagination of nature which is more powerful than your own
- Look for simpler things that other people have overlooked especially when they’ve been led astray by obsolete conventions, or by trying to do things that are superficially impressive
- Figure out what the real problem is, and make sure you solve that
- Don’t worry about trying to look corporate; the product is what wins in the long term
- And launch as soon s you can, so you start learning from users what you should have been making
